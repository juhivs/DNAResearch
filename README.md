This project is initial research project to explore working with Digital DNA data using BioJava

This project accesses PDBfiles from online repository mmtf.rcsb.org

Set system environment variable PDB_DIR to <location for PDB file download>

This project can be used -
1. To lookup any structure from the protein data bank(test1.java)
2. To analyse basic sequences (CoreModule.java)
3. To aling multiple protien structures and view the 3D model (Alignment.java)
4. To get gene location on a chromosome - uses data from ucsc online genome repository (ChromosomeParser)
5. To get gene sequence and nucleotide sequence (GenbankProxy)
